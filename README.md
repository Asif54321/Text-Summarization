# Text-Summarization

"Text-Summarization using Hugging Face and Flask" is a project that leverages Hugging Face's state-of-the-art natural language processing models to automatically condense lengthy text documents into concise summaries. It also incorporates Flask, a web framework for Python, to create a user-friendly interface. Users can input text, and the system uses Hugging Face's pre-trained models to generate coherent and meaningful summaries, making it a powerful tool for information retrieval and document summarization tasks. The Flask technology ensures that this functionality is accessible through a web application, making it easy for users to interact with the summarization tool.
